Context for the workplace. This directory is for a pomodoro application that I use to track my pomodoro sessions. It has a python server that logs the logs from the webapp in html and javascript.
These files are inside "src" folder. this directory is currently in windows but i use git to push this to github and then pull it in my ec2 amazon vps instance which I am logged in another terminal. 
in the ec2 server I am inside the directory called "Pomodoro_Fusion_v2" the server runs through a gunicorn instance and the ip that I connect to it through the website is http://16.171.52.110/
Here is the configuration of the instance.


[ec2-user@ip-172-31-21-167 Pomodoro_Fusion_v2]$ systemctl cat pomodoro.service
# /etc/systemd/system/pomodoro.service

Whenever you will make changes to the code or other stuff, you will then push the changes in git with 
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin main

Do not incorporate too much bs into commit message or introduce stupid characters. 

After pushing you should also instruct me to pull them in my ec2 server(rememver I am already in the folder called "Pomodoro_Fusion_v2" there.

When instructing about commands that I need to execute in my ec2 server consider that this is the version of Linux I am using there

NAME="Amazon Linux"
VERSION="2023"
ID="amzn"
ID_LIKE="fedora"
VERSION_ID="2023"
PLATFORM_ID="platform:al2023"
PRETTY_NAME="Amazon Linux 2023.7.20250623"
